# CLAUDE.md

This file provides context for AI assistants working on the **presetify** repository.

## Project Overview

**presetify** is a new project in its initial bootstrap phase. The repository currently contains only a README.md file. All tooling, source code, and configuration still need to be established.

## Repository Structure

```
presetify/
├── .git/           # Git repository
├── CLAUDE.md       # This file — AI assistant guide
└── README.md       # Project readme (placeholder)
```

## Current State

- **Status:** Skeleton repository — no source code, build system, or dependencies configured yet.
- **Branch model:** `main` is the default branch.
- **Single commit:** Initial commit with README.md.

## Development Setup

No development tooling has been configured yet. When setting up, the following will need to be established:

- Package manager and `package.json`
- Language/framework choice and configuration
- Linter and formatter
- Test framework
- Build/bundle tooling
- `.gitignore`

## Git Conventions

- The repository is hosted on GitHub.
- Commits are signed (SSH signing configured).
- Feature branches should use descriptive names.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is a greenfield project. When making changes, establish clean patterns from the start.
- Since there are no existing conventions yet, propose and document any conventions you introduce.
- Always update this CLAUDE.md file when adding significant tooling, structure, or conventions to the project.
- Keep the README.md updated as the project evolves.
